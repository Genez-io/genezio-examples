This project is a customized AI assistant. You can easily provide custom data by leveraging vector databases and chained prompts.

You can easily test it in Gitpod - an in-browser vscode solution:

## Steps to deploy

0. Run git clone `https://github.com/Genez-io/genezio-examples`.
1. Navigate to the folder `cd ./genezio-examples/typescript/langchain-starter`.
2. Get an OpenAI API key and save it in `server/.env`.
3. Fetch your custom data in `server/data`. Currently this project supports only `.md` files, but you can easily change that from `server/createVectorDatabase.ts`.
4. Populate the vector database by running `cd server && npm i && npx tsx createVectorDatabase.ts`. This will create a directory `lancedb` where the embeddings for you custom data are saved.
5. Run `genezio deploy --env server/.env`.
6. You can test your application using the subdomain provided in the output.

Note: Alternatively, instead of running `genezio deploy`, you can test locally by running `genezio local`.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `You may need to run npm install @lancedb/vectordb-linux-x64-gnu.`

This probably happens because your machine is arm-based - Apple M1/M2.

Currently, `lancedb` does not provide an easy way to do cross building from darwin-arm to linux-arm or linux-x86.

The recommend fix is to use gitpod to manually deploy this project. Follow [this link](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Genez-io/genezio-examples) to clone this repository and tinker with it in Gitpod.
To finish the gitpod setup, execute the following commands:
```
npm install -g genezio
genezio login <genezio_access_token>
cd genezio-examples/typescript/langchain-starter
genezio deploy --env ./server/.env
```

A persistent solution for your project is to setup a deployment workflow using Github Actions.

You can easily do this by using Github Actions and setting up an workflow to deploy your application for each commit.
Check out this [tutorial](https://genezio.com/docs/integrations/github-action/) for setting github actions with genezio.
